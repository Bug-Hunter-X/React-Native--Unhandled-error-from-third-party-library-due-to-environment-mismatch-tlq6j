Several approaches can mitigate this issue:

1. **Check for Environment:** Before using any module or API, explicitly check if it's available in the current environment.

```javascript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const isNode = Platform.OS === 'node';

function useMyLibrary(){
if (isNode) {
  // Use Node.js specific code here
  // ...
} else {
  // Use React Native specific code here 
  // ... or handle the absence of functionality gracefully
}
}
```

2. **Use React Native Alternatives:** For some Node.js modules, React Native provides alternatives. Check the React Native documentation for suitable replacements.

3. **Conditional Loading:** Only import or utilize the library in situations where you're certain the necessary environment features are available.

4. **Error Handling:** Wrap potentially problematic code in a `try...catch` block to prevent app crashes and handle the failure gracefully. 

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error using third-party library:', error);
  // Implement appropriate fallback mechanism
}
```

5. **Polyfills:** Consider creating polyfills for missing functionality, but this approach requires careful consideration and testing.
