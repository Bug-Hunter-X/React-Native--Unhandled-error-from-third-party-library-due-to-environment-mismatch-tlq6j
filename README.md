# React Native: Third-party Library Environment Mismatch
This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: using a third-party library that assumes a Node.js environment instead of the React Native environment.  This can cause errors when the library attempts to use Node.js-specific modules or DOM APIs.

The `environmentMismatchBug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `environmentMismatchSolution.js` provides a potential solution involving proper error handling and conditional logic or alternative libraries.

This issue is common when integrating libraries not designed specifically for React Native. Always check the library's documentation to ensure compatibility and look for alternatives if compatibility issues exist.
