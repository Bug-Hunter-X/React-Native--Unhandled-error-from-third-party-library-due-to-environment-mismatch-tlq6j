This error occurs when using a third-party library that doesn't handle the environment correctly. For example, if a library assumes a Node.js environment and you're using it in React Native, it might throw an error because some Node.js modules are not available in the React Native environment. This is common when using libraries that rely on the `fs` module or other Node.js-specific modules.  Another example is libraries expecting DOM APIs which are unavailable in React Native.
